### Workflow 3: Reviewing Analysis Results

**Time Required**: Varies (5-15 minutes per item)  
**Frequency**: After each scan or as items are assigned

#### What You'll Do

Examine the AI-generated analysis for each detected regulatory change and decide on next steps.

#### Understanding the Analysis

Each result includes:

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of Regulatory Tracker

**Trust the Confidence Scores**  
Use them to prioritize your time. High-confidence analyses need less scrutiny; low-confidence items deserve more attention.

**Keep Statuses Current**  
Accurate status tracking is the key to visibility. Encourage your team to update statuses promptly as they work.

**Leverage Auto-Generated Documents**  
Don't recreate the wheel. The system generates professional, audit-ready documentation automatically—use it!

**Establish a Rhythm**  
Consistent monitoring is more effective than sporadic deep dives. Build Regulatory Tracker into your daily routine.

**Combine AI Insights with Human Judgment**  
The AI analysis accelerates your work, but your expertise and judgment are essential. Use the system as a powerful assistant, not a replacement for critical thinking.
