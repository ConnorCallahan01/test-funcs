# Regulatory Tracker Business Case

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: February 2026  
**Prepared For**: Executive Leadership Team  
**Classification**: Internal - Confidential

---

## Executive Summary

This business case presents the strategic rationale for implementing the Regulatory Tracker solution — an automated regulatory compliance monitoring system designed to transform how our organization identifies, analyzes, and responds to regulatory changes.

**The Opportunity**: Our current manual compliance monitoring process consumes significant resources, creates operational risk through delayed detection of regulatory changes, and limits our ability to scale compliance operations effectively.

**The Solution**: Regulatory Tracker is a cloud-ready, three-tier system that automates regulatory scanning across 50+ sources, provides intelligent change detection, and delivers a unified dashboard for compliance oversight.

**Key Benefits**:
- **70-75% reduction** in daily monitoring time
- **85% faster** regulatory change detection (from 3-5 days to same-day)
- **$847,000 - $1.27M** estimated annual savings at full maturity
- **Significant risk reduction** through elimination of manual monitoring gaps

**Recommendation**: Approve investment in the Regulatory Tracker solution with a projected payback period of 10-14 months and three-year ROI of 285-340%.

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Process Overview

Our compliance team currently relies on manual processes to monitor regulatory changes across multiple jurisdictions and regulatory bodies. This involves:

- **Daily manual scanning** of 50+ regulatory websites and publications
- **Manual documentation** of identified changes in spreadsheets
- **Email-based communication** for team coordination and escalation
- **Periodic manual audits** to verify compliance status

### Quantified Pain Points

| Challenge | Current Impact | Business Risk |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Time-intensive monitoring | 4-6 hours daily per analyst | High labor costs, analyst burnout |
| Delayed change detection | 3-5 day average lag time | Compliance gaps, regulatory exposure |
| Inconsistent documentation | Variable quality across team | Audit failures, accountability gaps |
| Limited scalability | Linear headcount increase required | Cannot support business growth |
| Knowledge concentration | Expertise siloed in individuals | Key-person dependency risk |

### Current Cost Structure

| Cost Category | Annual Cost |
|---------------|-------------|
| Compliance analyst time (monitoring activities) | $420,000 - $520,000 |
| Manager oversight and review | $85,000 - $110,000 |
| Remediation of missed changes (estimated) | $150,000 - $300,000 |
| External audit preparation | $45,000 - $65,000 |
| **Total Current Annual Cost** | **$700,000 - $995,000** |
