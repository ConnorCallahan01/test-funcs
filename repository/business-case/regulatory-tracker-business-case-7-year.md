## Executive Summary

This business case presents the strategic rationale for implementing the Regulatory Tracker solution — an automated regulatory compliance monitoring system designed to transform how our organization identifies, analyzes, and responds to regulatory changes. This extended analysis provides a **7-year financial projection** to support long-term capital planning and strategic investment decisions.

**The Opportunity**: Our current manual compliance monitoring process consumes significant resources, creates operational risk through delayed detection of regulatory changes, and limits our ability to scale compliance operations effectively.

**The Solution**: Regulatory Tracker is a cloud-ready, three-tier system that automates regulatory scanning across 50+ sources, provides intelligent change detection, and delivers a unified dashboard for compliance oversight.

**Key Benefits**:
- **70-75% reduction** in daily monitoring time
- **85% faster** regulatory change detection (from 3-5 days to same-day)
- **$772,000 - $1.19M** estimated annual savings at full maturity
- **Significant risk reduction** through elimination of manual monitoring gaps

**7-Year Investment Summary**:

| Metric | Conservative | Optimistic |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| **Total Investment** | $1,668,170 | $2,579,060 |
| **Total Benefits** | $5,121,550 | $7,861,445 |
| **Net Value Created** | $3,453,380 | $5,282,385 |
| **7-Year ROI** | 207% | 205% |
| **NPV (8% discount)** | $2,197,000 | $3,362,000 |

**Recommendation**: Approve investment in the Regulatory Tracker solution with a projected payback period of 10-14 months and exceptional long-term value creation over the 7-year horizon.

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Process Overview

Our compliance team currently relies on manual processes to monitor regulatory changes across multiple jurisdictions and regulatory bodies. This involves:

- **Daily manual scanning** of 50+ regulatory websites and publications
- **Manual documentation** of identified changes in spreadsheets
- **Email-based communication** for team coordination and escalation
- **Periodic manual audits** to verify compliance status

### Quantified Pain Points

| Challenge | Current Impact | Business Risk |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Time-intensive monitoring | 4-6 hours daily per analyst | High labor costs, analyst burnout |
| Delayed change detection | 3-5 day average lag time | Compliance gaps, regulatory exposure |
| Inconsistent documentation | Variable quality across team | Audit failures, accountability gaps |
| Limited scalability | Linear headcount increase required | Cannot support business growth |
| Knowledge concentration | Expertise siloed in individuals | Key-person dependency risk |

### Current Cost Structure

| Cost Category | Annual Cost |
|---------------|-------------|
| Compliance analyst time (monitoring activities) | $420,000 - $520,000 |
| Manager oversight and review | $85,000 - $110,000 |
| Remediation of missed changes (estimated) | $150,000 - $300,000 |
| External audit preparation | $45,000 - $65,000 |
| **Total Current Annual Cost** | **$700,000 - $995,000** |

### 7-Year Cost Projection (Without Solution)

Assuming 3% annual cost inflation and organic business growth requiring additional compliance capacity:

| Year | Projected Annual Cost | Cumulative Cost |
|------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Year 1 | $847,500 | $847,500 |
| Year 2 | $908,000 | $1,755,500 |
| Year 3 | $972,000 | $2,727,500 |
| Year 4 | $1,041,000 | $3,768,500 |
| Year 5 | $1,114,000 | $4,882,500 |
| Year 6 | $1,192,000 | $6,074,500 |
| Year 7 | $1,276,000 | $7,350,500 |

**7-Year Total Cost (Do Nothing)**: $7.35M
